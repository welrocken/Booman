toUpperCamelCase to seperate words; either through seperators (e.g. ".", ",", " ", "_", "-") or via some dictionary or any other smart solution. And would make all the words UpperCamelCase.

To add mappings in terms of "this site should go to this folder".
To add a popup, allowing user to configure some "things".
To add an option that would override the default AddBookmark of Chrome; via listeners.
